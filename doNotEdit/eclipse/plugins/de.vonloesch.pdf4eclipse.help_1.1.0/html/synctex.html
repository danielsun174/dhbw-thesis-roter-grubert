<h1>SyncTeX support</h1>
SyncTeX is a extension, which enables synchronization of pdf documents and 
its (La)TeX sources. 
It is supported in most modern LaTeX distributions, e.g., 
in <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeXLive</a> since TeXLive 2008 and 
in <a href="http://miktex.org">MikTeX</a> since version 2.7.<br />

To enable SyncTeX for your build, you need to activate it with the 
<tt>-synctex</tt> command line switch, 
e.g., <tt>pdflatex -synctex=1 test.tex</tt> <br />
<br />
More technical details about SyncTeX can be found on the official 
<a href="http://itexmac.sourceforge.net/SyncTeX.html">SyncTeX page</a>.<br />
<br />
Pdf4Eclipse natively supports SyncTeX and enables the user to use both the 
forward and inverse search features.
For this it uses its own SyncTeX parser, since there is no official Java 
implementation. 
Therefore, it can happen that the forward and inverse search results are 
different from the results in other PDF viewers. 

<h2>Forward search</h2>
By <i>forward search</i> we denote the process of finding the position in the 
pdf file that corresponds to the cursor position in the active tex-file. 
<b>For a successful forward search it is necessary that the corresponding pdf 
file is already open in Eclipse.</b>
To make a forward search, open the context menu by right-clicking somewhere 
in the editor and selecting <i>Forward search</i>. Another possibility is to 
use the short key <i>Ctrl+Alt+F</i>.<br />

This command is enabled in every text editor.

<h2>Inverse search</h2>
By <i>inverse search</i> we denote the process of the line in the source file
that corresponds to the mouse cursor position in the pdf-file. 
A inverse search is triggered by a simple double-click in the pdf document on 
the searched position. If it successful, 
Pdf4Eclipse opens the source file and highlights the line that fits best.

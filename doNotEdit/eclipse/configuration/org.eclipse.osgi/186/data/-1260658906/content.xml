          Eclipse Public License -v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,&#xA;   publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense&#xA;   the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such&#xA;   derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;   &#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,&#xA;   offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution&#xA;   of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code&#xA;   form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of&#xA;   the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the&#xA;   Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the&#xA;   Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the&#xA;   Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any&#xA;   other combinations which include the Contribution.&#xA;   No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;   &#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants&#xA;   the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no&#xA;   assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program&#xA;   does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property&#xA;   rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any&#xA;   liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity&#xA;   based on infringement of intellectual property rights or&#xA;   otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and&#xA;   licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole&#xA;   responsibility to secure any other intellectual property&#xA;   rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent&#xA;   license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the&#xA;   Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire&#xA;   that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has&#xA;   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to&#xA;   grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;   &#xA;   &#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object&#xA;code form under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;&#xA;   and&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;   warranties and conditions, express and implied, including&#xA;   warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and&#xA;   implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and&#xA;   fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;    liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,&#xA;    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement&#xA;     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other&#xA;     party; and&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from&#xA;    such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in&#xA;    a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used&#xA;    for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of&#xA;   the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within&#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its&#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows&#xA;subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities&#xA; with respect to end users, business partners and&#xA;the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the&#xA;commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner&#xA;which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.&#xA;Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial&#xA;product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;)&#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor&#xA;(&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs&#xA;(collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other&#xA;legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified&#xA;Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such&#xA;Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this&#xA;section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any&#xA;actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to&#xA;qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial&#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor&#xA;to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense&#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified&#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.&#xA;If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#xA;warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and&#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone.&#xA;Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims&#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and&#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages&#xA;as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT&#xA;LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,&#xA;NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the&#xA;appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes&#xA;all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this&#xA;Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of&#xA;program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or&#xA;loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or&#xA;interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT&#xA;NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,&#xA;INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND&#xA;ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,&#xA;OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE&#xA;OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or&#xA;enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,&#xA;and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision&#xA;shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such&#xA;provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging&#xA;that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program&#xA;with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s&#xA;patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under&#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if&#xA;it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions&#xA;of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable&#xA;period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If&#xA;all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient&#xA;agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as&#xA;reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under&#xA;this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating&#xA;to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this&#xA;Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is&#xA;copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The&#xA;Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions&#xA;(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one&#xA;other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this&#xA;Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement&#xA;Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to&#xA;serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity.&#xA;Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing&#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always&#xA;be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under&#xA;which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the&#xA;Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the&#xA;Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.&#xA;Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,&#xA;Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual&#xA;property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether&#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in&#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of&#xA;New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States&#xA;of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action&#xA;under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action&#xA;arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any&#xA;resulting litigation.

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS&#xA;ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR&#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE&#xA;OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and&#xA;   documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate&#xA;from and are distributed by that particular Contributor.&#xA;A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was&#xA;added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on&#xA;such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions&#xA;to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed&#xA;in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and&#xA;(ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA; &#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the&#xA;              Program.&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor&#xA;                   which are necessarily infringed by the use or&#xA;                   sale of its Contribution alone or when&#xA;                   combined with the Program.&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with&#xA;          this Agreement.&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this&#xA;            Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xA;            &#xA;            &#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,&#xA;   publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense&#xA;   the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such&#xA;   derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;   &#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,&#xA;   offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution&#xA;   of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code&#xA;   form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of&#xA;   the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the&#xA;   Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the&#xA;   Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the&#xA;   Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any&#xA;   other combinations which include the Contribution.&#xA;   No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;   &#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants&#xA;   the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no&#xA;   assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program&#xA;   does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property&#xA;   rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any&#xA;   liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity&#xA;   based on infringement of intellectual property rights or&#xA;   otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and&#xA;   licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole&#xA;   responsibility to secure any other intellectual property&#xA;   rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent&#xA;   license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the&#xA;   Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire&#xA;   that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has&#xA;   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to&#xA;   grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;   &#xA;   &#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object&#xA;code form under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;&#xA;   and&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;   warranties and conditions, express and implied, including&#xA;   warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and&#xA;   implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and&#xA;   fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;    liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,&#xA;    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement&#xA;     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other&#xA;     party; and&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from&#xA;    such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in&#xA;    a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used&#xA;    for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of&#xA;   the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within&#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its&#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows&#xA;subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities&#xA; with respect to end users, business partners and&#xA;the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the&#xA;commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner&#xA;which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.&#xA;Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial&#xA;product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;)&#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor&#xA;(&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs&#xA;(collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other&#xA;legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified&#xA;Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such&#xA;Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this&#xA;section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any&#xA;actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to&#xA;qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial&#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor&#xA;to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense&#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified&#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.&#xA;If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#xA;warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and&#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone.&#xA;Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims&#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and&#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages&#xA;as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT&#xA;LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,&#xA;NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the&#xA;appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes&#xA;all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this&#xA;Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of&#xA;program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or&#xA;loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or&#xA;interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT&#xA;NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,&#xA;INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND&#xA;ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,&#xA;OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE&#xA;OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or&#xA;enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,&#xA;and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision&#xA;shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such&#xA;provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging&#xA;that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program&#xA;with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s&#xA;patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under&#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if&#xA;it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions&#xA;of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable&#xA;period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If&#xA;all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient&#xA;agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as&#xA;reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under&#xA;this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating&#xA;to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this&#xA;Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is&#xA;copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The&#xA;Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions&#xA;(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one&#xA;other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this&#xA;Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement&#xA;Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to&#xA;serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity.&#xA;Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing&#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always&#xA;be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under&#xA;which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the&#xA;Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the&#xA;Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.&#xA;Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,&#xA;Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual&#xA;property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether&#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in&#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of&#xA;New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States&#xA;of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action&#xA;under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action&#xA;arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any&#xA;resulting litigation.

          Eclipse Public License -v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

          Eclipse Public License -v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

The obligations in this&#xA;section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any&#xA;actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to&#xA;qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial&#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor&#xA;to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense&#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified&#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.&#xA;If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#xA;warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and&#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone.&#xA;Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims&#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and&#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages&#xA;as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5.

          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;&#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in&#xA;    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;    parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an&#xA;    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this&#xA;    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on&#xA;    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;&#xA;    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;    received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;                            NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS&#xA;ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR&#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE&#xA;OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and&#xA;   documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate&#xA;from and are distributed by that particular Contributor.&#xA;A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was&#xA;added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on&#xA;such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions&#xA;to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed&#xA;in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and&#xA;(ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA; &#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the&#xA;              Program.&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor&#xA;                   which are necessarily infringed by the use or&#xA;                   sale of its Contribution alone or when&#xA;                   combined with the Program.&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with&#xA;          this Agreement.&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this&#xA;            Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xA;            &#xA;            &#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,&#xA;   publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense&#xA;   the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such&#xA;   derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;   &#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,&#xA;   offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution&#xA;   of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code&#xA;   form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of&#xA;   the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the&#xA;   Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the&#xA;   Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the&#xA;   Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any&#xA;   other combinations which include the Contribution.&#xA;   No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;   &#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants&#xA;   the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no&#xA;   assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program&#xA;   does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property&#xA;   rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any&#xA;   liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity&#xA;   based on infringement of intellectual property rights or&#xA;   otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and&#xA;   licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole&#xA;   responsibility to secure any other intellectual property&#xA;   rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent&#xA;   license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the&#xA;   Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire&#xA;   that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has&#xA;   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to&#xA;   grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;   &#xA;   &#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object&#xA;code form under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;&#xA;   and&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;   warranties and conditions, express and implied, including&#xA;   warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and&#xA;   implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and&#xA;   fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;    liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,&#xA;    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement&#xA;     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other&#xA;     party; and&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from&#xA;    such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in&#xA;    a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used&#xA;    for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of&#xA;   the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within&#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its&#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows&#xA;subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities&#xA; with respect to end users, business partners and&#xA;the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the&#xA;commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner&#xA;which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.&#xA;Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial&#xA;product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;)&#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor&#xA;(&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs&#xA;(collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other&#xA;legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified&#xA;Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such&#xA;Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this&#xA;section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any&#xA;actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to&#xA;qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial&#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor&#xA;to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense&#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified&#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.&#xA;If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#xA;warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and&#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone.&#xA;Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims&#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and&#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages&#xA;as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT&#xA;LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,&#xA;NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the&#xA;appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes&#xA;all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this&#xA;Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of&#xA;program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or&#xA;loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or&#xA;interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT&#xA;NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,&#xA;INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND&#xA;ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,&#xA;OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE&#xA;OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or&#xA;enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,&#xA;and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision&#xA;shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such&#xA;provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging&#xA;that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program&#xA;with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s&#xA;patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under&#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if&#xA;it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions&#xA;of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable&#xA;period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If&#xA;all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient&#xA;agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as&#xA;reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under&#xA;this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating&#xA;to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this&#xA;Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is&#xA;copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The&#xA;Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions&#xA;(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one&#xA;other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this&#xA;Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement&#xA;Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to&#xA;serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity.&#xA;Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing&#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always&#xA;be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under&#xA;which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the&#xA;Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the&#xA;Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.&#xA;Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,&#xA;Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual&#xA;property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether&#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in&#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of&#xA;New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States&#xA;of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action&#xA;under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action&#xA;arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any&#xA;resulting litigation.

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS&#xA;ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR&#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE&#xA;OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and&#xA;   documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate&#xA;from and are distributed by that particular Contributor.&#xA;A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was&#xA;added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on&#xA;such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions&#xA;to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed&#xA;in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and&#xA;(ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA; &#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the&#xA;              Program.&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor&#xA;                   which are necessarily infringed by the use or&#xA;                   sale of its Contribution alone or when&#xA;                   combined with the Program.&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with&#xA;          this Agreement.&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this&#xA;            Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xA;            &#xA;            &#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,&#xA;   publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense&#xA;   the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such&#xA;   derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;   &#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,&#xA;   offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution&#xA;   of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code&#xA;   form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of&#xA;   the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the&#xA;   Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the&#xA;   Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the&#xA;   Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any&#xA;   other combinations which include the Contribution.&#xA;   No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;   &#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants&#xA;   the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no&#xA;   assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program&#xA;   does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property&#xA;   rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any&#xA;   liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity&#xA;   based on infringement of intellectual property rights or&#xA;   otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and&#xA;   licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole&#xA;   responsibility to secure any other intellectual property&#xA;   rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent&#xA;   license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the&#xA;   Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire&#xA;   that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has&#xA;   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to&#xA;   grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;   &#xA;   &#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object&#xA;code form under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;&#xA;   and&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;   warranties and conditions, express and implied, including&#xA;   warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and&#xA;   implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and&#xA;   fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;    liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,&#xA;    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement&#xA;     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other&#xA;     party; and&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from&#xA;    such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in&#xA;    a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used&#xA;    for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of&#xA;   the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within&#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its&#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows&#xA;subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities&#xA; with respect to end users, business partners and&#xA;the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the&#xA;commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner&#xA;which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.&#xA;Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial&#xA;product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;)&#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor&#xA;(&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs&#xA;(collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other&#xA;legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified&#xA;Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such&#xA;Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this&#xA;section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any&#xA;actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to&#xA;qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial&#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor&#xA;to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense&#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified&#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.&#xA;If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#xA;warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and&#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone.&#xA;Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims&#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and&#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages&#xA;as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT&#xA;LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,&#xA;NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the&#xA;appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes&#xA;all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this&#xA;Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of&#xA;program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or&#xA;loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or&#xA;interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT&#xA;NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,&#xA;INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND&#xA;ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,&#xA;OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE&#xA;OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or&#xA;enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,&#xA;and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision&#xA;shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such&#xA;provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging&#xA;that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program&#xA;with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s&#xA;patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under&#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if&#xA;it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions&#xA;of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable&#xA;period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If&#xA;all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient&#xA;agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as&#xA;reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under&#xA;this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating&#xA;to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this&#xA;Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is&#xA;copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The&#xA;Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions&#xA;(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one&#xA;other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this&#xA;Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement&#xA;Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to&#xA;serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity.&#xA;Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing&#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always&#xA;be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under&#xA;which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the&#xA;Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the&#xA;Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.&#xA;Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,&#xA;Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual&#xA;property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether&#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in&#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of&#xA;New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States&#xA;of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action&#xA;under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action&#xA;arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any&#xA;resulting litigation.

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS&#xA;ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR&#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE&#xA;OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and&#xA;   documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate&#xA;from and are distributed by that particular Contributor.&#xA;A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was&#xA;added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on&#xA;such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions&#xA;to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed&#xA;in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and&#xA;(ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA; &#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the&#xA;              Program.&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor&#xA;                   which are necessarily infringed by the use or&#xA;                   sale of its Contribution alone or when&#xA;                   combined with the Program.&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with&#xA;          this Agreement.&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this&#xA;            Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xA;            &#xA;            &#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,&#xA;   publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense&#xA;   the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such&#xA;   derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;   &#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,&#xA;   offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution&#xA;   of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code&#xA;   form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of&#xA;   the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the&#xA;   Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the&#xA;   Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the&#xA;   Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any&#xA;   other combinations which include the Contribution.&#xA;   No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;   &#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants&#xA;   the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no&#xA;   assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program&#xA;   does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property&#xA;   rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any&#xA;   liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity&#xA;   based on infringement of intellectual property rights or&#xA;   otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and&#xA;   licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole&#xA;   responsibility to secure any other intellectual property&#xA;   rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent&#xA;   license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the&#xA;   Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire&#xA;   that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has&#xA;   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to&#xA;   grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;   &#xA;   &#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object&#xA;code form under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;&#xA;   and&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;   warranties and conditions, express and implied, including&#xA;   warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and&#xA;   implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and&#xA;   fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;    liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,&#xA;    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement&#xA;     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other&#xA;     party; and&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from&#xA;    such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in&#xA;    a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used&#xA;    for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of&#xA;   the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within&#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its&#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows&#xA;subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities&#xA; with respect to end users, business partners and&#xA;the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the&#xA;commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner&#xA;which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.&#xA;Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial&#xA;product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;)&#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor&#xA;(&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs&#xA;(collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other&#xA;legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified&#xA;Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such&#xA;Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this&#xA;section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any&#xA;actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to&#xA;qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial&#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor&#xA;to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense&#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified&#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.&#xA;If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#xA;warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and&#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone.&#xA;Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims&#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and&#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages&#xA;as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT&#xA;LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,&#xA;NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the&#xA;appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes&#xA;all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this&#xA;Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of&#xA;program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or&#xA;loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or&#xA;interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT&#xA;NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,&#xA;INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND&#xA;ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,&#xA;OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE&#xA;OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or&#xA;enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,&#xA;and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision&#xA;shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such&#xA;provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging&#xA;that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program&#xA;with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s&#xA;patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under&#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if&#xA;it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions&#xA;of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable&#xA;period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If&#xA;all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient&#xA;agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as&#xA;reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under&#xA;this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating&#xA;to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this&#xA;Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is&#xA;copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The&#xA;Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions&#xA;(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one&#xA;other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this&#xA;Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement&#xA;Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to&#xA;serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity.&#xA;Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing&#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always&#xA;be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under&#xA;which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the&#xA;Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the&#xA;Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.&#xA;Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,&#xA;Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual&#xA;property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether&#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in&#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of&#xA;New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States&#xA;of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action&#xA;under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action&#xA;arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any&#xA;resulting litigation.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR&#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE&#xA;OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and&#xA;   documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate&#xA;from and are distributed by that particular Contributor.&#xA;A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was&#xA;added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on&#xA;such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions&#xA;to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed&#xA;in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and&#xA;(ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA; &#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the&#xA;              Program.&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor&#xA;                   which are necessarily infringed by the use or&#xA;                   sale of its Contribution alone or when&#xA;                   combined with the Program.&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with&#xA;          this Agreement.&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this&#xA;            Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xA;            &#xA;            &#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,&#xA;   publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense&#xA;   the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such&#xA;   derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;   &#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,&#xA;   offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution&#xA;   of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code&#xA;   form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of&#xA;   the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the&#xA;   Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the&#xA;   Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the&#xA;   Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any&#xA;   other combinations which include the Contribution.&#xA;   No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;   &#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants&#xA;   the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no&#xA;   assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program&#xA;   does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property&#xA;   rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any&#xA;   liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity&#xA;   based on infringement of intellectual property rights or&#xA;   otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and&#xA;   licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole&#xA;   responsibility to secure any other intellectual property&#xA;   rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent&#xA;   license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the&#xA;   Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire&#xA;   that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has&#xA;   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to&#xA;   grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;   &#xA;   &#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object&#xA;code form under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;&#xA;   and&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;   warranties and conditions, express and implied, including&#xA;   warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and&#xA;   implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and&#xA;   fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;    liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,&#xA;    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement&#xA;     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other&#xA;     party; and&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from&#xA;    such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in&#xA;    a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used&#xA;    for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of&#xA;   the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within&#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its&#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows&#xA;subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities&#xA; with respect to end users, business partners and&#xA;the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the&#xA;commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner&#xA;which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.&#xA;Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial&#xA;product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;)&#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor&#xA;(&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs&#xA;(collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other&#xA;legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified&#xA;Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such&#xA;Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this&#xA;section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any&#xA;actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to&#xA;qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial&#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor&#xA;to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense&#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified&#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.&#xA;If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#xA;warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and&#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone.&#xA;Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims&#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and&#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages&#xA;as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT&#xA;LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,&#xA;NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the&#xA;appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes&#xA;all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this&#xA;Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of&#xA;program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or&#xA;loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or&#xA;interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT&#xA;NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,&#xA;INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND&#xA;ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,&#xA;OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE&#xA;OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or&#xA;enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,&#xA;and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision&#xA;shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such&#xA;provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging&#xA;that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program&#xA;with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s&#xA;patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under&#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if&#xA;it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions&#xA;of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable&#xA;period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If&#xA;all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient&#xA;agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as&#xA;reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under&#xA;this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating&#xA;to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this&#xA;Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is&#xA;copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The&#xA;Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions&#xA;(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one&#xA;other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this&#xA;Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement&#xA;Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to&#xA;serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity.&#xA;Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing&#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always&#xA;be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under&#xA;which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the&#xA;Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the&#xA;Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.&#xA;Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,&#xA;Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual&#xA;property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether&#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in&#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of&#xA;New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States&#xA;of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action&#xA;under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action&#xA;arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any&#xA;resulting litigation.

GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or&#xA;enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,&#xA;and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision&#xA;shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such&#xA;provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging&#xA;that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program&#xA;with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s&#xA;patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under&#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if&#xA;it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions&#xA;of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable&#xA;period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If&#xA;all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient&#xA;agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as&#xA;reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under&#xA;this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating&#xA;to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this&#xA;Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is&#xA;copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The&#xA;Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions&#xA;(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one&#xA;other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this&#xA;Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement&#xA;Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to&#xA;serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity.&#xA;Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing&#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always&#xA;be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under&#xA;which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the&#xA;Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the&#xA;Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.&#xA;Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,&#xA;Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual&#xA;property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether&#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in&#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of&#xA;New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States&#xA;of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action&#xA;under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action&#xA;arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any&#xA;resulting litigation.

          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;&#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in&#xA;    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;    parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an&#xA;    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this&#xA;    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on&#xA;    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;&#xA;    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;    received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;                            NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS&#xA;ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR&#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE&#xA;OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and&#xA;   documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate&#xA;from and are distributed by that particular Contributor.&#xA;A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was&#xA;added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on&#xA;such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions&#xA;to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed&#xA;in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and&#xA;(ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA; &#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the&#xA;              Program.&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor&#xA;                   which are necessarily infringed by the use or&#xA;                   sale of its Contribution alone or when&#xA;                   combined with the Program.&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with&#xA;          this Agreement.&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this&#xA;            Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xA;            &#xA;            &#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,&#xA;   publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense&#xA;   the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such&#xA;   derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;   &#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,&#xA;   offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution&#xA;   of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code&#xA;   form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of&#xA;   the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the&#xA;   Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the&#xA;   Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the&#xA;   Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any&#xA;   other combinations which include the Contribution.&#xA;   No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;   &#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants&#xA;   the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no&#xA;   assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program&#xA;   does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property&#xA;   rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any&#xA;   liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity&#xA;   based on infringement of intellectual property rights or&#xA;   otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and&#xA;   licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole&#xA;   responsibility to secure any other intellectual property&#xA;   rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent&#xA;   license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the&#xA;   Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire&#xA;   that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has&#xA;   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to&#xA;   grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;   &#xA;   &#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object&#xA;code form under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;&#xA;   and&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;   warranties and conditions, express and implied, including&#xA;   warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and&#xA;   implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and&#xA;   fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;    liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,&#xA;    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement&#xA;     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other&#xA;     party; and&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from&#xA;    such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in&#xA;    a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used&#xA;    for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of&#xA;   the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within&#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its&#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows&#xA;subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities&#xA; with respect to end users, business partners and&#xA;the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the&#xA;commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner&#xA;which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.&#xA;Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial&#xA;product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;)&#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor&#xA;(&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs&#xA;(collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other&#xA;legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified&#xA;Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such&#xA;Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this&#xA;section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any&#xA;actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to&#xA;qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial&#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor&#xA;to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense&#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified&#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.&#xA;If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#xA;warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and&#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone.&#xA;Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims&#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and&#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages&#xA;as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT&#xA;LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,&#xA;NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the&#xA;appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes&#xA;all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this&#xA;Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of&#xA;program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or&#xA;loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or&#xA;interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT&#xA;NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,&#xA;INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND&#xA;ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,&#xA;OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE&#xA;OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or&#xA;enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,&#xA;and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision&#xA;shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such&#xA;provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging&#xA;that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program&#xA;with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s&#xA;patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under&#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if&#xA;it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions&#xA;of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable&#xA;period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If&#xA;all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient&#xA;agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as&#xA;reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under&#xA;this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating&#xA;to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this&#xA;Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is&#xA;copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The&#xA;Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions&#xA;(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one&#xA;other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this&#xA;Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement&#xA;Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to&#xA;serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity.&#xA;Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing&#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always&#xA;be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under&#xA;which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the&#xA;Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the&#xA;Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.&#xA;Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,&#xA;Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual&#xA;property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether&#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in&#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of&#xA;New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States&#xA;of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action&#xA;under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action&#xA;arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any&#xA;resulting litigation.

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS&#xA;ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR&#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE&#xA;OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and&#xA;   documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate&#xA;from and are distributed by that particular Contributor.&#xA;A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was&#xA;added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on&#xA;such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions&#xA;to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed&#xA;in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and&#xA;(ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA; &#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the&#xA;              Program.&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor&#xA;                   which are necessarily infringed by the use or&#xA;                   sale of its Contribution alone or when&#xA;                   combined with the Program.&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with&#xA;          this Agreement.&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this&#xA;            Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xA;            &#xA;            &#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,&#xA;   publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense&#xA;   the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such&#xA;   derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;   &#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,&#xA;   offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution&#xA;   of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code&#xA;   form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of&#xA;   the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the&#xA;   Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the&#xA;   Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the&#xA;   Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any&#xA;   other combinations which include the Contribution.&#xA;   No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;   &#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants&#xA;   the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no&#xA;   assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program&#xA;   does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property&#xA;   rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any&#xA;   liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity&#xA;   based on infringement of intellectual property rights or&#xA;   otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and&#xA;   licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole&#xA;   responsibility to secure any other intellectual property&#xA;   rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent&#xA;   license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the&#xA;   Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire&#xA;   that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has&#xA;   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to&#xA;   grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;   &#xA;   &#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object&#xA;code form under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;&#xA;   and&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;   warranties and conditions, express and implied, including&#xA;   warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and&#xA;   implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and&#xA;   fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;    liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,&#xA;    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement&#xA;     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other&#xA;     party; and&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from&#xA;    such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in&#xA;    a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used&#xA;    for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of&#xA;   the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within&#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its&#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows&#xA;subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities&#xA; with respect to end users, business partners and&#xA;the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the&#xA;commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner&#xA;which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.&#xA;Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial&#xA;product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;)&#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor&#xA;(&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs&#xA;(collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other&#xA;legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified&#xA;Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such&#xA;Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this&#xA;section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any&#xA;actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to&#xA;qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial&#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor&#xA;to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense&#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified&#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.&#xA;If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#xA;warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and&#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone.&#xA;Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims&#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and&#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages&#xA;as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT&#xA;LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,&#xA;NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the&#xA;appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes&#xA;all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this&#xA;Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of&#xA;program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or&#xA;loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or&#xA;interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT&#xA;NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,&#xA;INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND&#xA;ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,&#xA;OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE&#xA;OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or&#xA;enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,&#xA;and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision&#xA;shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such&#xA;provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging&#xA;that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program&#xA;with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s&#xA;patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under&#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if&#xA;it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions&#xA;of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable&#xA;period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If&#xA;all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient&#xA;agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as&#xA;reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under&#xA;this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating&#xA;to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this&#xA;Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is&#xA;copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The&#xA;Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions&#xA;(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one&#xA;other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this&#xA;Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement&#xA;Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to&#xA;serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity.&#xA;Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing&#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always&#xA;be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under&#xA;which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the&#xA;Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the&#xA;Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.&#xA;Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,&#xA;Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual&#xA;property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether&#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in&#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of&#xA;New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States&#xA;of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action&#xA;under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action&#xA;arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any&#xA;resulting litigation.

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS&#xA;ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR&#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE&#xA;OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and&#xA;   documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate&#xA;from and are distributed by that particular Contributor.&#xA;A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was&#xA;added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on&#xA;such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions&#xA;to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed&#xA;in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and&#xA;(ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA; &#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the&#xA;              Program.&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor&#xA;                   which are necessarily infringed by the use or&#xA;                   sale of its Contribution alone or when&#xA;                   combined with the Program.&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with&#xA;          this Agreement.&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this&#xA;            Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xA;            &#xA;            &#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,&#xA;   publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense&#xA;   the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such&#xA;   derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;   &#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,&#xA;   offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution&#xA;   of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code&#xA;   form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of&#xA;   the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the&#xA;   Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the&#xA;   Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the&#xA;   Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any&#xA;   other combinations which include the Contribution.&#xA;   No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;   &#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants&#xA;   the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no&#xA;   assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program&#xA;   does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property&#xA;   rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any&#xA;   liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity&#xA;   based on infringement of intellectual property rights or&#xA;   otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and&#xA;   licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole&#xA;   responsibility to secure any other intellectual property&#xA;   rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent&#xA;   license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the&#xA;   Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire&#xA;   that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has&#xA;   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to&#xA;   grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;   &#xA;   &#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object&#xA;code form under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;&#xA;   and&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;   warranties and conditions, express and implied, including&#xA;   warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and&#xA;   implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and&#xA;   fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;    liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,&#xA;    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement&#xA;     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other&#xA;     party; and&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from&#xA;    such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in&#xA;    a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used&#xA;    for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of&#xA;   the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within&#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its&#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows&#xA;subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities&#xA; with respect to end users, business partners and&#xA;the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the&#xA;commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner&#xA;which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.&#xA;Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial&#xA;product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;)&#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor&#xA;(&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs&#xA;(collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other&#xA;legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified&#xA;Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such&#xA;Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this&#xA;section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any&#xA;actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to&#xA;qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial&#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor&#xA;to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense&#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified&#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.&#xA;If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#xA;warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and&#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone.&#xA;Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims&#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and&#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages&#xA;as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT&#xA;LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,&#xA;NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the&#xA;appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes&#xA;all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this&#xA;Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of&#xA;program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or&#xA;loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or&#xA;interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT&#xA;NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,&#xA;INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND&#xA;ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,&#xA;OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE&#xA;OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or&#xA;enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,&#xA;and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision&#xA;shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such&#xA;provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging&#xA;that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program&#xA;with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s&#xA;patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under&#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if&#xA;it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions&#xA;of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable&#xA;period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If&#xA;all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient&#xA;agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as&#xA;reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under&#xA;this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating&#xA;to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this&#xA;Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is&#xA;copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The&#xA;Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions&#xA;(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one&#xA;other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this&#xA;Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement&#xA;Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to&#xA;serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity.&#xA;Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing&#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always&#xA;be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under&#xA;which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the&#xA;Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the&#xA;Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.&#xA;Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,&#xA;Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual&#xA;property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether&#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in&#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of&#xA;New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States&#xA;of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action&#xA;under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action&#xA;arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any&#xA;resulting litigation.

Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2.

In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR&#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE&#xA;OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and&#xA;   documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate&#xA;from and are distributed by that particular Contributor.&#xA;A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was&#xA;added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on&#xA;such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions&#xA;to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed&#xA;in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and&#xA;(ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA; &#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the&#xA;              Program.&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor&#xA;                   which are necessarily infringed by the use or&#xA;                   sale of its Contribution alone or when&#xA;                   combined with the Program.&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with&#xA;          this Agreement.&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this&#xA;            Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xA;            &#xA;            &#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,&#xA;   publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense&#xA;   the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such&#xA;   derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;   &#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,&#xA;   offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution&#xA;   of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code&#xA;   form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of&#xA;   the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the&#xA;   Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the&#xA;   Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the&#xA;   Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any&#xA;   other combinations which include the Contribution.&#xA;   No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;   &#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants&#xA;   the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no&#xA;   assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program&#xA;   does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property&#xA;   rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any&#xA;   liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity&#xA;   based on infringement of intellectual property rights or&#xA;   otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and&#xA;   licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole&#xA;   responsibility to secure any other intellectual property&#xA;   rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent&#xA;   license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the&#xA;   Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire&#xA;   that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has&#xA;   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to&#xA;   grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;   &#xA;   &#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object&#xA;code form under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;&#xA;   and&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;   warranties and conditions, express and implied, including&#xA;   warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and&#xA;   implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and&#xA;   fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;    liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,&#xA;    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement&#xA;     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other&#xA;     party; and&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from&#xA;    such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in&#xA;    a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used&#xA;    for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of&#xA;   the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within&#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its&#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows&#xA;subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities&#xA; with respect to end users, business partners and&#xA;the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the&#xA;commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner&#xA;which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.&#xA;Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial&#xA;product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;)&#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor&#xA;(&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs&#xA;(collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other&#xA;legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified&#xA;Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such&#xA;Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this&#xA;section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any&#xA;actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to&#xA;qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial&#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor&#xA;to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense&#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified&#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.&#xA;If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#xA;warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and&#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone.&#xA;Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims&#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and&#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages&#xA;as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5.

Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the&#xA;appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes&#xA;all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this&#xA;Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of&#xA;program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or&#xA;loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or&#xA;interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT&#xA;NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,&#xA;INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND&#xA;ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,&#xA;OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE&#xA;OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or&#xA;enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,&#xA;and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision&#xA;shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such&#xA;provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging&#xA;that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program&#xA;with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s&#xA;patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under&#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if&#xA;it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions&#xA;of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable&#xA;period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance.

This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents.

DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America.

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS&#xA;ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR&#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE&#xA;OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and&#xA;   documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate&#xA;from and are distributed by that particular Contributor.&#xA;A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was&#xA;added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on&#xA;such Contributor&apos;s behalf. Contributions do not include additions&#xA;to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed&#xA;in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and&#xA;(ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#xA; &#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the&#xA;              Program.&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor&#xA;                   which are necessarily infringed by the use or&#xA;                   sale of its Contribution alone or when&#xA;                   combined with the Program.&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with&#xA;          this Agreement.&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this&#xA;            Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xA;            &#xA;            &#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,&#xA;   publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense&#xA;   the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such&#xA;   derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#xA;   &#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xA;   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xA;   patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,&#xA;   offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution&#xA;   of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code&#xA;   form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of&#xA;   the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the&#xA;   Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the&#xA;   Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the&#xA;   Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any&#xA;   other combinations which include the Contribution.&#xA;   No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;   &#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants&#xA;   the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no&#xA;   assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program&#xA;   does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property&#xA;   rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any&#xA;   liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity&#xA;   based on infringement of intellectual property rights or&#xA;   otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and&#xA;   licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole&#xA;   responsibility to secure any other intellectual property&#xA;   rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent&#xA;   license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the&#xA;   Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire&#xA;   that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has&#xA;   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to&#xA;   grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;   &#xA;   &#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object&#xA;code form under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;&#xA;   and&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;   warranties and conditions, express and implied, including&#xA;   warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and&#xA;   implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and&#xA;   fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all&#xA;    liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,&#xA;    incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement&#xA;     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other&#xA;     party; and&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from&#xA;    such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in&#xA;    a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used&#xA;    for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of&#xA;   the Program.&#xA;   &#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within&#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its&#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows&#xA;subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities&#xA; with respect to end users, business partners and&#xA;the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the&#xA;commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner&#xA;which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.&#xA;Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial&#xA;product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;)&#xA;hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor&#xA;(&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs&#xA;(collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other&#xA;legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified&#xA;Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such&#xA;Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the&#xA;Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this&#xA;section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any&#xA;actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to&#xA;qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial&#xA;Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor&#xA;to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense&#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified&#xA;Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#xA;offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.&#xA;If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#xA;warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and&#xA;warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone.&#xA;Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims&#xA;against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and&#xA;warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages&#xA;as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM&#xA;IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT&#xA;LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,&#xA;NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the&#xA;appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes&#xA;all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this&#xA;Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of&#xA;program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or&#xA;loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or&#xA;interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT&#xA;NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,&#xA;INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND&#xA;ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,&#xA;OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE&#xA;OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or&#xA;enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,&#xA;and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision&#xA;shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such&#xA;provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging&#xA;that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program&#xA;with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s&#xA;patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under&#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if&#xA;it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions&#xA;of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable&#xA;period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance.

DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT&#xA;NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,&#xA;INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND&#xA;ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,&#xA;OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE&#xA;OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or&#xA;enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,&#xA;and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision&#xA;shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such&#xA;provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging&#xA;that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program&#xA;with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s&#xA;patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s rights granted under&#xA;Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if&#xA;it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions&#xA;of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable&#xA;period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If&#xA;all Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient&#xA;agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as&#xA;reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under&#xA;this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating&#xA;to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this&#xA;Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is&#xA;copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner.

The Program (including Contributions) may always&#xA;be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under&#xA;which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the&#xA;Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the&#xA;Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.&#xA;Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,&#xA;Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual&#xA;property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether&#xA;expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
